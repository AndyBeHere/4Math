## intro to arcsine
- radians: what sine of pi over 4 is in a uint circle
- calculation of sine: opposite sides（对边） over hypoteuse（斜边） 
  - eg. in an isosceles triangle, the value is square root of 1/2
  - question: sin of what equals to square root of 2 over 2? pi/4 + n*2pi(n is an integer)
- doamin of arcsine: 
  - question: taking the arcsine of x, and let it equal to theta, what's the domain restricted to? [-1,1]
  - theta is restricted to being less than or equal to pi over 2 and then greater than or equal to minus pi over 2
